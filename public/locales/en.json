    "IntroParagraphThree": "There are several ways to create an optimized portfolio. However, before doing so, one must first quantify the level of risk that is suitable to one's own aspired returns on investments. Some people are risk takers, other people are risk averse.",

    "FirstParagraphOne": "Perfolio is your intuitive, all-in-one, independent and privacy-friendly extension of your classical stock portfolio. One aspect that makes Perfolio different from all the other stock portfolios you know from banks or neo-brokers is the fact that Perfolio brings all your assets into one place offering exceptional possibilities.",
    "FirstParagraphTwo": "Just think about it. Some of the following questions might have occurred before if you are investing:",

    "SecondParagraphThree": "For retail investors, it complicates sustainable investment decisions",
    "ThirdParagraphOne": "Broken down, metrics are a measurement of anything. The most classic measurement in the financial market is that of value. Be it, that of stocks, crypto or even real state. Accordingly, everyone has encountered a measurement in some way. So, in order to see whether you have made a loss or a profit since the aquisition, you have to rely on a measurement. Therefore, measurement or metrics are essential when it comes to investments.",
    "ThirdParagraphTwo": "However, at Perfolio, in addition to basic measurements such as the value, we provide you with a wide range of far more sophisticated metrics that allow you to obtain in-depth information about individual values in order to make the ultimate best investment decision. Moreover, we not only offer metrics for individual stocks, but also allow you to gain insights into your entire portfolio.",
